## 2. Core Features — 9 Modules

### Module 1: Authentication (AUTH)

The authentication system handles user identity, security, and session management.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Email/Password Signup | Users register with email and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage. |
| Email/Password Login | Authenticated via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Returns access token + refresh token pair. |
| Google OAuth | One-click signup/login using Google account via Passport.js Google strategy. |
| Email Verification | After registration, a 6-digit OTP is sent to the user's email. Account is unverified until OTP is confirmed. |
| Forgot Password | User requests a password reset link/OTP sent to their registered email. |
| Reset Password | User sets a new password using the reset token/OTP received via email. |
| Refresh Tokens | Access tokens are short-lived (15 min). Refresh tokens (7 days) are used to obtain new access tokens without re-login. |
| Session Management | Active sessions tracked. Logout invalidates the current refresh token. |
| Profile Setup | After auth, users can set display name, upload avatar (Cloudinary/Supabase Storage), and configure preferences. |

**Auth Flow:**
```
Register → Verify Email (OTP) → Login → Access Token (15min) + Refresh Token (7d)
                                          ↓ (on expiry)
                                   Refresh Token → New Access Token
```
